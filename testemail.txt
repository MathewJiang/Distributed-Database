Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...

Risk believes that the marking the curves based on last Enron trades is a better way to mark the curve.  The discrepancy came when Barclay's tried to margin Enron based on Bloomberg prices (which was incorrect - it should have been the Bloomberg/Air Daily formula).

Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...

put chairman.enron@enron.com Subject: Organizational Announcement From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

From 7:00 - 9:00 p.m., Server HR-DB-4 will be shutdown to replace disks. Affected apps will be all HRGlobal applications including but not limited to Global Launch Zone, HRGIS, GCS, eHRonline, etc. From 3:00 - 9:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  If you need access to 3AC anytime Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information.  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access. 3AC Telco and Voicemail services will be unavailable during the outage period. From 10:30 p.m. - 11:00 p.m., Fiber maintenance will be performed in the 41st floor wiring closet. This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet to the 41st floor server room.  Connectivity between servers in the 41st floor server room and the Enron network will be disrupted. The cabling engineer believes the change should take less than 30 minutes.  If he runs into a problem, the outage could possibly be two hours. From 1:45 a.m. - 2:15 a.m., sysAdmiral master system will be shut down during the time change from Daylight Savings Time to Standard Time. This is being done as a precautionary measure due to a potential sysAdmiral bug.

put chairman.enron@enron.com Subject: Organizational Announcement From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

put listsupport@internet.com Subject: ISR Morning Report - June 8, 2001 From a valuation standpoint, neither stock is a screaming buy at these levels. Intel is trading at 55 times this year's expected earnings, which are predicted to fall 63%. And it is trading at 40 times 2002 estimated earnings, which are expected to be half what the company earned in 2000. For a company with an expected long-term growth rate of 18%, that is one expensive stock.

put center.ets@enron.com Subject: ETS and Corporate Change Control From 5:00 p.m.  through 2/14 at 6:00 a.m., the Envision team will perform hardware maintenance on the Envision system.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices.  From 10:30 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will fail over Internet traffic to the primary firewall.  This change will result in a 10-15 second outage for Internet traffic and access to servers on the 192.189.171.0 and 65.201.84.0 DMZ segments.  This change will be coordinated with HotTap and will not take place until processing is completed.  Support staff with application servers on the DMZ should plan on testing their applications after this change. From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

put center.ets@enron.com Subject: ETS and Corporate Change Control Items From 12:00 a.m. through 10/07 at 11:45 p.m., Enron Network Services is implementing a moratorium on all network changes one week prior through one week after the first move of users to Enron Center South.  This moratorium will probably be limited to routing changes, no new networks, no changes to existing networks, etc.  No impact to ETS networks is expected. From 9:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., the EDI team will replace the backup EDI server located in Omaha.   The existing server will be de-commissioned.  The new server will take over the dns and IP address of the old server.   No impact is expected as this server is used for disaster recovery. From 11:00 p.m. through 10/5 at 2:00 a.m., the Unix team will rename the edinet.enron.com and ecnet.enron.com systems.  During last Saturday's EDI change, the DNS entries were changes but the actual servers were not changed to reflect their new names.  They will also install patches to the machines during the maintenance.  This change will result in a total disruption of service to EDI Web access only.  EDI will not be affected. From 4:00 - 6:00 p.m., the Monitoring group will bring up the new ITContacts site and disable the old.  We are currently not using this site but there are plans to access it in the future.  No impact is expected. From 7:00 - 8:00 p.m., the Corp server team will perform maintenance on the HR-DB-4 server to add more disk space.  This change will result in a disruption of service to all HR Global applications including eHRonline, GCS, GIS, expertfinder, etc. From 9:00 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will split the two 8 port gig channels from ECS to ECN into four 4 port gig channels.  This change will fully mesh the ECS core.  No impact is expected. From 9:00 - 11:45 p.m., the Messaging team will Test Upgrade functions of XTND 2.6.  This change affects PDA users who log into XTND.  No impact to ETS users is expected.  X-tend Connect Proxy servers will be unavailable on 10/5/01 from 9:00-11:45pm.  Palm Pilot users who use X-tend Connect Proxy to sync with Outlook will be unable to do so during this time.   From 9:00 p.m. through 10/6 at 1:00 a.m., the Messaging team will reboot all Corp and EI Notes servers.  No impact to ETS users is expected. From 10:00 - 10:15, Enron Network Services will migrate the following Corp servers on the 172.16.63.0 network:  foglight, charon, hyperion, perch, diablo, vision, ricky, dbadmin, worf, riker, europa, titania, pandora, ferrari, pluto, hades, opal, cyclopes, astral, and modena.  No impact to ETS is expected.

put center.ets@enron.com Subject: ETS and Corporate Change Control Items From 6:00 - 6:30 p.m., ENS will be opening a DMZ firewall port to allow users on HOTTAPTS11 to run the NBPL Oracle application on nb2175.nbp.enron.com. From 7:00 - 9:00 p.m., Server HR-DB-4 will be shutdown to replace disks. Affected apps will be all HRGlobal applications including but not limited to Global Launch Zone, HRGIS, GCS, eHRonline, etc. From 3:00 - 9:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  If you need access to 3AC anytime Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information.  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access. 3AC Telco and Voicemail services will be unavailable during the outage period. From 10:30 p.m. - 11:00 p.m., Fiber maintenance will be performed in the 41st floor wiring closet. This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet to the 41st floor server room.  Connectivity between servers in the 41st floor server room and the Enron network will be disrupted. The cabling engineer believes the change should take less than 30 minutes.  If he runs into a problem, the outage could possibly be two hours. From 1:45 a.m. - 2:15 a.m., sysAdmiral master system will be shut down during the time change from Daylight Savings Time to Standard Time. This is being done as a precautionary measure due to a potential sysAdmiral bug.

From 10:00 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will clean up routing between ecn-34-prd-dcr7/8 and ecn-34-trd-dcr1/2 which are part of the old ECT networks.  No impact to the ETS users is expected. From 10:30 p.m. through 12/15 at 2:00 a.m., Enron Network Services will remove routing from the 192.168.73.x interfaces on ENA-CR1-ARD and ENA-CR2-ARD. This change will result in an intermittent disruption of service to devices on the ETS Ardmore networks.  This change will not affect devices on the 10.0.0.0 segment.  The outage is expected to last for less than two minutes.  This change is necessary to fully implement the new MAN.   From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken down one at a time during the maintenance.

This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.

put chairman.enron@enron.com Subject: Organizational Announcement From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

From the manufacturer perspective, what are the factors that are considered when starting the production and what are the factors considered when shutting the production down.  I assume it is not only the differential price between ammonia and natural gas.

Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

Please keep up the good work.  However, PADI and the diving industry do need your help in another way.  Recently, an Associated Press article, based on a study by the National Sporting Goods Association, was released saying that US participation in scuba diving fell way off in 2000.  I know it's not true because PADI's numbers were up and we represent the lion's share of the market.  So how can you help?  When you're asked to participate in any market survey,  please take a minute to answer the questions and let them know you are not only a diver, but also a PADI diver. When they ask about activities, name scuba.

After the start and once the crowd thinned out, I got into my groove (after pulling over for a quick relief stop) and stayed within my own and kept a moderate speed with a high cadence.  The sun was above the clouds, but while en route a large, dark menacing cloud seemed to head my direction, but thankfully it amounted to nothing and the cloud cover remained most of the day.

By defining the index as PJM plus $0.0[   ] per kWh, we effectively tie the deal cost to the index and mark the transactions accordingly.  Please see my note previous note on this issue.   From August 1, 2003 through the end of the Transaction Term, there will be no additional charges for Excess Usage; however, for each kWh of Deficiency Usage at each Account for each month, you will pay us an amount equal to the 0.0[ ] per kWh multiplied by the Deficiency Usage.

Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

put chairman.enron@enron.com Subject: Organizational Announcement From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

put russell.dyk@enron.com Subject: FW: Trades as ENA From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect.  From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now.

Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

Whatever the case would be, we would have to have controls on quality in our tank, and insist on seeing the analysis on everything before it goes into the tank.
