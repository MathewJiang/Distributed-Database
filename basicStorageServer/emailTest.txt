Please keep up the good work.  However, PADI and the diving industry do need your help in another way.  Recently, an Associated Press article, based on a study by the National Sporting Goods Association, was released saying that US participation in scuba diving fell way off in 2000.  I know it's not true because PADI's numbers were up and we represent the lion's share of the market.  So how can you help?  When you're asked to participate in any market survey,  please take a minute to answer the questions and let them know you are not only a diver, but also a PADI diver. When they ask about activities, name scuba.
